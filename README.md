# Asteroids Game 🚀

A classic **Asteroids-style game** developed as part of the Boot.dev backend curriculum. This project was built to reinforce concepts in game loops, collision detection, and object-oriented programming using Python and Pygame.

## 🎮 Features

- Player-controlled spaceship with rotation and thrust
- Asteroid generation and movement
- Bullet firing with collision detection
- Game over and reset functionality

> Note: Infinite screen wrap-around and score tracking are planned but not yet implemented.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Library**: Pygame
- **Development Environment**: Ubuntu (Linux)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ installed
- Pygame installed (`pip install pygame`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/asteroids-game.git
   cd asteroids-game

2. Run the game:
  python main.py

📚 What I Learned

    Structuring a game loop in Python

    Handling keyboard input and basic physics

    Object-oriented design for game entities

    Using Pygame for 2D graphics and animation

🧠 Future Improvements

    Implement infinite screen wrap-around

    Add score tracking and UI

    Introduce more complex asteroid behavior

    Add background music and sound effects
